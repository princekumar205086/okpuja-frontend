# Puja Services Components Redesign Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive redesign and improvements made to the puja-services components with a focus on professional UI/UX, mobile-first approach, and enhanced functionality.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Package Filtering Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When creating/updating packages, all packages were being fetched instead of only those related to the specific puja service.

**Solution**:

- Now packages are fetched with the specific service ID to maintain proper filtering
