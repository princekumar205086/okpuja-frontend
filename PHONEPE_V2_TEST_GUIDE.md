# PhonePe V2 Payment Integration - Test Guide

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Updated Payment Flow

### Prerequisites
1. Development server is running (`pnpm dev`)
2. Backend server is running with PhonePe V2 endpoints
3. Environment variables are configured correctly

### Test Steps

#### 1. Basic Payment Flow Test
```bash
# Navigate to your application
http://localhost:3000

# Follow these steps:
1. Browse puja services
2. Add a service to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Select address
5. Proceed to payment
6. Test payment completion
```

#### 2. Test Scenarios

**Scenario A: Successful Payment**
- Complete normal checkout flow
- Payment should redirect to `confirmbooking` page
- Booking should be created automatically
- Cart should be cleared

**Scenario B: Failed Payment**
- Use invalid payment details (if possible in sandbox)
- Should redirect to `failedbooking` page
- Cart items should be retained
- Error details should be displayed

**Scenario C: Pending Payment**
- If payment gets stuck in PENDING state
- Use the test page: `http://localhost:3000/test-payment`
- Enter payment ID and simulate success

#### 3. API Endpoints Testing

The updated payment flow uses these endpoints:
```
POST /api/payment/payments/ - Create payment
GET /api/payment/payments/{id}/status/ - Check status
POST /api/payment/webhook/phonepe/v2/ - Webhook handler
POST /api/payment/payments/{id}/create-booking/ - Create booking
```

#### 4. Environment Variables

Make sure these are set correctly:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONEPE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL=http://localhost:3000/confirmbooking
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_FAILURE_URL=http://localhost:3000/failedbooking
```

#### 5. Troubleshooting

**If payment fails:**
1. Check backend logs for PhonePe API connectivity
2. Verify webhook URL configuration
3. Use test payment page for debugging
4. Check network tab for API calls

**If booking is not created:**
1. Payment might be stuck in PENDING
2. Use webhook retry mechanism
3. Check backend booking creation endpoint

#### 6. Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Update environment variables to production URLs
2. Configure PhonePe merchant with production webhook URL
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
4. Test with real payment methods
