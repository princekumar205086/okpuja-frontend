- `PRODUCTION_PAYMENT_ERROR_SOLUTION.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Check Production Environment Variables
```bash
# SSH into your production server and verify:
echo $PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID
echo $PHONEPE_MERCHANT_KEY  
echo $PHONEPE_SALT_KEY

# These should match your working local environment exactly
```

### Step 2: Test Network Connectivity
```bash
# From production server, test:
curl -v https://api.phonepe.com/apis/hermes
curl -I https://api.phonepe.com

# Check DNS resolution:
nslookup api.phonepe.com

# Test HTTPS port:
telnet api.phonepe.com 443
```

### Step 3: Contact Hosting Provider
Ask your hosting provider to verify:
- ✅ Outbound HTTPS connections to `api.phonepe.com` are allowed
- ✅ No firewall blocking external API calls  
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificates properly configured
- ✅ No rate limiting on external requests

### Step 4: Temporary Debug (Optional)
Add the debug component to your checkout page:
```tsx
import ProductionDebugHelper from '../components/ProductionDebugHelper';

// Add to your checkout page temporarily:
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && <ProductionDebugHelper />}
```

## 🎯 Expected Resolution Timeline

### Immediate (0-2 hours):
- Verify environment variables match local
- Test network connectivity from production server
- Contact hosting provider if needed

### Short-term (2-24 hours):
- Hosting provider fixes connectivity issues
- Payment gateway working in production
- Remove debug components

### Long-term (1-7 days):
- Monitor payment success rates
- Implement additional error handling if needed
- Consider backup payment methods

## 📞 Support Contacts

### For Hosting Provider:
**Questions to Ask:**
1. "Can my production server make HTTPS requests to api.phonepe.com?"
2. "Are there any firewall rules blocking external API calls?"
3. "Are SSL certificates configured for outbound requests?"
4. "Are there any geographic or IP-based restrictions?"

### For PhonePe Support:
**Questions to Ask:**
1. "Does my production server IP need to be whitelisted?"
2. "Are there different API endpoints for production vs sandbox?"
3. "Are there rate limits that might block requests?"
